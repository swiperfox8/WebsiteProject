Welcome to your tragedy...dundundun

tis ol' cracker is a bit of hink. You wanna know what we have in store for ye, do ye?

Well, tis web application as ye call it now a days will show the depths of your internal despair. 

A Medievial themed web application with the utilization of HTML/CSS/Vanilla Javascript and Python, our team of four: Shahana Nizar, Rajvi Maisuria, Meera Bhola, Geno Diaz created a fun and humourous way to entertain you with insults that Bards are accustomed to. There are four web pages: Home, D20 (Dice roller), Bard Roaster (random insult generator), and Story Time which is a Mad Libs inspired Bard story. 

We hope you enjoy our application!
