      <h2>What is a bard?</h2>

      <p class = "beg">

      A medieval bard is a poet, musician, and storyteller whose sole purpose is to entertain the people. Their livelihood depends on the patronage of the upper class, including the royal family, nobility <br> and the order of the knights, or in some cases, the generosity of the common folks. 

      Bards are not deserving of any respect, have no previous education and are considered almost equivalent <br> to the peasantry, who are among the lowest class of society. They are privileged with the assistance of the noble men or common people to receive enough shillings for their food and sustenance. If<br> bards do not give their complete submission and deference to their saviors, they will eventually become an outcast or a peasant of the society.
