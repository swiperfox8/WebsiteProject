- What is a bard?

A medieval bard is a poet, musician, and storyteller whose sole purpose is to entertain the people. Their livelihood depends on the patronage of the upper class, including the royal family, nobility and the order of the knights, or in some cases, the generosity of the common folks. 

Bards are not deserving of any respect, have no previous education and are considered almost equivalent to the peasantry, who are among the lowest class of society. They are privileged with the assistance of the noble men or common people to receive enough shillings for their food and sustenance. If bards do not give their complete submission and deference to their saviors, they will eventually become an outcast or a peasant of the society.

Madlibs Storytime



- Bards are lowest society classes
- Storytellers - included tales of heroic deeds, mythical creatures, ancient battles, and the lives of important figure
- generally eat bread if they have money, or eat porridge/cottage
- should never offend any nobility/royal, could result in expulsion from land, punishment or even death
- 1 pound = 20 shillings 
- if invited to noble feast for entertainment, they could eat better leftovers at the party
- instruments used: harp (best), lyre (2nd best), flute (ok), drum (worst)
- their patronage from the nobility depends on their flattery and performance
    - more support = less insults?
- over-flatter will also get them to be punished, as it seems like they are being sarcastic/insulting the nobility
    - could make it impossible to always make all the nobility happy, since the bard would praise one noble highly, which would offend another noble, but the power dynamic between nobilty would make the higher noble's punishment harsher (death), while the lower noble's punishment is torture
        - offending a popular knight results in becoming an outcast by the common folks
